Data, field photos and manuscripts on yeast ecology

Photographs of oak trees and fig trees sampled for yeast from 2006-2011 are in fieldphotos. Used together with the longitude and latitude coordinates, these can be used to identify host plants, so that it is possible for others to resample the same host individuals.
